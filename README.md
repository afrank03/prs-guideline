## Mentality
Don't be afraid to **REJECT** PR.
> Straight reasons to reject:
> - Poor solution quality
> - Standards are not met
> - Security issues
> - **Q**uality, **U**nderstanding, **A**greement, **D**eployment, **S**ecurity.

> - PR is too BIG (see agreed limits)

### Things to remember
What PR's are **NOT**
> - PR's, are not just one way, dry opportunity to get your code to `master`
> - PR's, are not for personal arguments, as well as they are not designed to abuse you or anyone else

What PR's **ARE**
> - PR's, are opportunities to learn. This works both ways as for reviewer as well as for PR creator
> - PR's, are designed to get our code quality as close as possible to standards we follow **(link to our standards?)**
> - PR's, are collective effort, not single engineer
